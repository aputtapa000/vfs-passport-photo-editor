## Usage Tips

- Use a **plain background** and wear **colored attire** (avoid pure white or distracting patterns) for best results.
- Take a front-facing photo with **eyes open** and **natural expression**.
- Lighting should be even to avoid **shadows** on face or background.
- If you want, use a tool like **Adobe Background Remover** (free online) before uploading to get a clean subject on transparent background.
- The app tries to detect the face and position it correctly but is limited by the photo quality.

---

## App Details

- The app scales and crops the image so the **head height** is around **26 mm**, the midpoint in the 25-35 mm official range.
- The **eyes are positioned roughly 28-34 mm** from the bottom of the image.
- The output image is a **square 2x2 inch (600 x 600 px at 300 DPI)** image with a **white background**.
- Measurements are calculated based on landmarks detected by Mediapipe's face mesh model (468 landmark points).

---

## Troubleshooting

- If no face is detected:
  - Make sure the image is clear, well-lit, with a front-facing head.
  - Try a different photo or improve lighting/background.

- If warnings show "attire too white":
  - Wear a colored shirt; pure white is discouraged in official photos.

- If you get high contrast warnings:
  - Adjust lighting to minimize harsh shadows.
